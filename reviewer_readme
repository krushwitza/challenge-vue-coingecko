So basically I know that at this stage the major performance issue is still present. I tried to remove it but unfortunately I've failed. I think it's related to BaseLineCrypto.vue re-rendering when currenciesList is updated in store. The components should be kept in memory when user is switching views. I tried some keep-alive solutions and switching BaseDynamicList component when the page change happens but it didn't improve performance. If this is possible, please send me some hints about the solution. If not than well, have a god day :)
